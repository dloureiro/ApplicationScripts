# Applications scripts for SysFera-DS


This project is part of SysFera-DS.

See http://www.sysfera.com/sysfera-ds.html for more information.

## Synopsis
This project contains example scripts and pre-scripts for applications used by
SysFera-DS WebBoard (see http://www.sysfera.com/sysfera-ds/webboard.html for
more details). Those scripts can also be used with Vishnu
(http://www.sysfera.com/vishnu).

Each application script is present in a separate directory.

The common directory contains:
- a template for creating application scripts
- Python files for creating pre-scripts
